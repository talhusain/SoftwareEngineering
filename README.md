# Project Title :squirrel:
A web-based torrent client written in Python.

Installation
---
The only requirement for the software is that [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) be installed.

[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is useful for cloning the repo and keeping it up to date but not required.

After the repository is cloned, it can be ran by running the commands.

`docker build -t slothtorrent .`
`docker run -p 80:5000 slothtorrent`

Note that the build may take a long time to download the dependencies depending on the connection.
